## Features

- Generates a basic Ulauncher extension structure.
- Includes a `main.py` file with basic extension logic.
- Provides a `manifest.json` file for extension configuration.
- Creates a `versions.json` file for version information.
- Creates a `requirements.txt` file for package dependencies.
- Creates an `images` directory for extension icons.

## Usage

To use this tool, run the `ulauncher-generator` command, and follow the prompts to create a new extension.
